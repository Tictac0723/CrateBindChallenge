# CrateBindChallenge

This is a project that I created in order to show my skills in React and Javascript to the company CrateBind. I created a React project that uses the GitHub REST API to show user's repositories ordered by which ones have the most stars. (no including forked repos). The user of the application should be able to search a user's name in an input field and the pinned repos update. 


To get the app started:
1. git clone the repo
2. Run the following commands in terminal 
* npm install
* npm start

and then you are ready to go!
